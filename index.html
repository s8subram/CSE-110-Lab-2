			<h2>Day 1</h2>

			<p>All is quiet. Too quiet. I fear the <strong>beast</strong> that hunts my crew has finished off everyone save myself. At this rate, I suspect that I will be unable to make it back to Earth in time for my CS class, which is of course my foremost concern while trapped in a spaceship with a ravenous alien predator seeking my blood.</p>

			<p>I shall now regale you with my backstory, ostensibly physical and clearly nonsapient journal of mine.</p>

			<p>It feels like it was only yesterday that I first boarded the <i>SS CoolShipName</i> bound for Earth from somewhere in the Andromeda galaxy. I likely feel this way because it <em>was</em> only yesterday, but it feels like a lifetime ago. I suspect that has something to do with the ravenous alien which has consumed most of my fellow crewmembers, most of whom were my close friends after having played a few board games last night.</p>

			<p>When I first came aboard, the captain gave me some strict orders: <br /> "<b>Don't get yerself killed, or it means more paperwork for me.</b>"</p>

			<p>Truly, the man was like a father to me in the few hours during which I knew him.</p>

			<p>However, I digress. Now, dear ostensibly physical journal, I shall provide you with an itemized list of my current supplies.</p>

			<div>
				<ul>
					<li><b>One</b> (1) left-hand standard issue space glove</li>
					<li><b>One</b> (1) right-hand standard issue space glove</li>
					<li><b>One</b> (1) military grade gasoline powered flamethrower, in working condition</li>
					<li><b>Three</b> (3) new AA batteries</li>
					<li><b>One</b> (1) functioning flashlight, at approximately 50% power</li>
					<li><b>Five</b> (5) fire extinguishers, all unused</li>
					<li><b>Four</b> (4) 200-liter drums, all full of gasoline</li>
				</ul>
